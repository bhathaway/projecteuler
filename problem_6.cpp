//The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
//12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

//The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
//(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

//Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and
// the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

//Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
// one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.



// This is not interesting enough to write code for. You can solve this in an equation.
// My final answer is (3*n^4 + 2*n^3 - 3*n^2 - 2n) / 12.

// For n = 100, the answer, using a calculator, is 25164150.
